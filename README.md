# Egress Network Port Tester

The script is designed to test egress (outbound) network connectivity by attempting to establish TCP connections to specified ports on a given host. It provides feedback on whether each connection attempt is successful or fails. The intent is to support quickly testing egress filtering or to aid in troubleshooting connectivity issues.
